# Summary of Week 13

## Managing files that should *not* be checked in to git

To do this, we created a plain text file called .gitignore

This can be in the root of your git repository, in which case it will apply to the entire repository.

And/or you can place a .gitignore file in any subdirectory of your git repository.

Usually the .gitignore file itself will be checked in



## Automated compiling using make

You create a text file, by convention called Makefile

Inside the file, you create targets and list the dependencies

```
target: dependency1 dependency2
______./command
```

## Enumerations

Namespaced list of values.
