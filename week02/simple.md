# Simplest C++ program

```C++
int main() {

  return 0;
}
```

This code represents the simplest legal C++ program.


## The main function is special in C++

When you compile a C++ program, the C++ compiler will look for a function called `main` with return type `int`.

When you run the program, this `main` function is where the code starts running.



## Every function in C++ contains four components

  * a return type 
  * a name
  * a parameter list
  * a body


In the main function above:
  * the return type is `int`
  * the name is `main`
  * the parameter list is empty (represented by the empty parentheses)
  * the body is everything between the curly braces
