int main() {

  return 0;
}


/*
  This code represents the simplest legal C++ program.

  When you compile a C++ program, 
    the compiler will look for a function called main with return type int.

  When you run the program, this main function is where the code starts running.

  Remember that every function contains four parts:

  * a return type 
  * a name
  * a parameter list
  * a body

  In the main function above:
  * the return type is int
  * the name is main
  * the parameter list is empty (represented by the empty parentheses)
  * the body is everything between the curly braces
